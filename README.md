[![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gin-gonic/gin?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin?tab=doc)

Gin-Gonic is a framework based on [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter). It's an HTTP multiplexer like gorilla/mux, but it is more fast. Gin allows a high-level API to create REST services.
